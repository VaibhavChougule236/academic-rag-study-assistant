    "# AI-Powered Academic RAG Study Assistant  \n",
    "## Experiment Results Document  \n",
    "### Subject: Database Management Systems (DBMS)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document summarizes all experiments conducted while building the RAG-based study assistant.  \n",

    "# Experiment 1: Chunking Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tested 2 approaches:\n",
    "  1. Fixed-size chunking (500 characters, 100 overlap)\n",
    "  2. Sentence-based chunking (preserving sentence boundaries)\n",
    "- Used 10 DBMS test questions\n",
    "- Evaluated using 3 metrics:\n",
    "  - Relevance (1–5)\n",
    "  - Correctness (1–5)\n",
    "  - Completeness (1–5)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "| Strategy            | Avg Relevance | Avg Correctness | Avg Completeness | Pros | Cons |\n",
    "|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|------|------|\n",
    "| Fixed Chunking     | 3.8           | 3.6             | 3.5              | Simple, fast | Cuts definitions mid-sentence |\n",
    "| Sentence Chunking  | 4.2           | 3.9             | 3.8              | Preserves context | Variable chunk size |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentence chunking preserved complete definitions better.\n",
    "- Fixed chunking sometimes split important explanations.\n",
    "- Conceptual questions (Normalization, ACID, 2PL) performed better with sentence chunks.\n",
    "- Structure-heavy topics (B-tree, DELETE vs TRUNCATE) still had limitations due to PDF formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence-based chunking performed better for DBMS materials because textbook content is structured in full explanatory sentences. Preserving sentence boundaries improved semantic clarity and answer completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Decision: **Sentence-based chunking selected for production.**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compared 2 prompt styles:\n",
    "  1. Basic prompt (simple instruction)\n",
    "  2. Improved structured prompt (clear constraints, structured instruction)\n",
    "- Used same 10 test questions\n",
    "- Evaluated on:\n",
    "  - Relevance\n",

    "| Improved Prompt  | 4.0           | 3.8             | 3.6              | More structured | Slightly more tokens |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic prompt generated extremely short answers.\n",
    "- Improved prompt produced clearer, more complete explanations.\n",
    "- Reduced hallucination.\n",
    "- ACID and Two-Phase Locking explanations improved significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering had a noticeable impact on answer completeness.  \n",
    "The improved structured prompt was selected for the final system.\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Top-k=3 gave most focused answers.\n",
    "- Increasing k introduced page headers and irrelevant chunks.\n",
    "- Larger context reduced answer precision.\n",
    "- DELETE vs TRUNCATE answers degraded with high k.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "More context does not always mean better performance.  \n",
    "Precision-based retrieval (Top-k=3) performed best.\n",

    "Final Decision: **Top-k = 3 selected for production.**\n",
