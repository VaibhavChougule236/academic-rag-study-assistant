    "## Objective\n",
    "To evaluate how different chunking strategies affect retrieval quality and answer generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategies Compared\n",
    "1. Fixed-size chunking (500 characters, 100 overlap)\n",
    "2. Sentence-based chunking (split using sentence boundaries)\n",

    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "- Relevance (1–5)\n",
    "- Correctness (1–5)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentence chunking preserved semantic boundaries better.\n",
    "- Fixed chunking sometimes cut definitions mid-sentence.\n",
    "- Sentence chunks produced more complete definitions (e.g., Normalization).\n",
    "- For structure-heavy topics like B-tree, both struggled slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade-Off\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fixed chunking is simple and fast.\n",
    "- Sentence chunking improves semantic clarity but produces variable chunk sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence-based chunking was selected for the final production system due to better semantic alignment and improved answer completeness.\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic prompt produced very short answers.\n",
    "- Improved prompt generated more structured responses.\n",
    "- Improved prompt reduced hallucination.\n",
    "- ACID and 2PL answers improved significantly.\n",

    "## Trade-Off\n",
    "\n",
